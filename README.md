## -Project description-

The goal of this project is to create a functioning software for managing a small pharmaceutical warehouse.

As a finalized product, our software will:

• Provide a way to manage the inventory of said warehouse


• To handle incoming and outgoing orders to pharmacies


• Provide a practical way to export invoices.


The project as a whole, will serve as a way to gain experience on teamwork, project management and coding and overall as first-hand experience to working on an actual project in our future workspace.

*This project is included as 30% of our final grade in this class.*

The Software and Quality Management class is taught by Dr. Theodore Pachidis at the International Hellenic University, IT Department _(former Technological Institute of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, Software Engineering Department)_ in the region of Kavála.
